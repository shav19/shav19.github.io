This week, instead of looking at Microsoft Sheet, we focused on trying to fix our github posts if needed and maybe upgrading them. I realised that I wasn't able to recall my github password which hindered my progress for that lesson. However Mr Tansley came and helped me by telling me to make a new password. I learnt new very valuable lessons from this scenario. First that I need to be always fully prepared for anything and I recall things that are likely to be continued from previous lessons. The second was more difficult but it was to show initiative when I am in a problem and find more than one method to solve the problem. However once I created a new password I had no other problems in the lesson and I was able to cope very well afterwards.
