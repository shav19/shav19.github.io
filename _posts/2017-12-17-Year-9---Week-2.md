This week I managed to improve my concentration but not to the highest ore exemplary level. What I said previously about not being able to go at the sufficient pace at the start can can have grave consequences which was seen today. As a result of some of the class's slowness we were a lesson behind. So while some of us had to catch up others were able to do more useful activities. However this was useful for me but I still had to ask help from the teacher. I need to be able to do activities fully independent and listen to the teacher the entire time. For next lesson I may do some extra work outside the lesson.
