    <td>This time we had to type up larger programs and more complicated ones. It was sometimes confusing on where we were but my partner and I were able to keep up. Since these programs were larger there was a higher chance of errors but it was okay because the both of us were able to spot errors and tell the person typing to fix it. So I learned that you should always look at what your partner is doing if they are doing the correct thing or that I am are doing the wrong thing. I also did not speak to the teacher about the work.</td>

    <td>Firstly my USB cable did not work again for the second time despite checking it at home. Incase it didn't work again I bought another one however my partner wouldnâ€™t allow me to use it because we had to carry on with the lesson so he told me that he would send it to me via google docs. Secondly as a minor improvement I could have quickened my typing because I was a bit slow and we could have made more progress.</td>

    <td>For next time I will try to test the other cable and if that does not work then I will see Mr Keen  about the issue. Before next lesson I might try some typing websites on the internet. This is so I can improve my typing skills because currently I am typing by having my hands above the keyboard and pressing the keys one at a time. Professionals have their entire hand on the keyboard and remember where all the keys are so can look on the screen the entire time. However a major improvement is to remember what have done in the lesson specifically such as the uses of loops or binary numbers. So in the future I should have a good read of what the purpose of doing that exercise is.</td>
