This week we finished off our spreadsheets for our shops and started a new subtopic. This topic is using Google sheets for ciphers and transmitting codes. Personally I found this harder than creating our business but not hard. However I needed to keep in track with what the teacher was doing because I was adding some improvements to my business sheets when others were starting making the new. Unfortunately this forced me to ask the person next to me which was what I try not to do.
