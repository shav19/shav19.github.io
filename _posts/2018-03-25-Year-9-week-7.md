This week was our last lesson of using sheets. We continued with using codes and ciphers in sheets. I believe on the whole that I have made progress in understanding sheets and its many different uses and capabilities. I now know how to use it for businesses and analysing something. However what I needed to work on was improving my concentration skills. By this I mean I needed to always focus and listen to what the teacher is saying.
