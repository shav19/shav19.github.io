This week we continued with using Python and experimented on trying to make the computer talk with the user. Once again I found this lesson easy because it was writing basic english. You merely had to write the sentences and fill in with variables. In this lesson I was able to accomplish my continuous target which is to work fully independently - this was mainly due to how similar the work was to writing in English. Occasionally I encountered an error but I was able to look back and solve it.
