Today we were tasked with putting the finishing touches to our sheets and fixing any remaining problems we had with our blogs. I looked back on the spreadsheet and I realised that I had nothing except one thing to do which was to add a drop-down menu. After I did this, I asked the teacher for what else I could do and he told me to embed the url of my spreadsheet into my blog post to show how far I am in the project. Personally I believe that I did generally well over the course so far and I can create spreadsheets as we were shown that it was relatively simple to do.
