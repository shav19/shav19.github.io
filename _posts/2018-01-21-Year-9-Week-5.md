Again we had a duplicate of last lesson but instead we were focusing on finishing off or reaching the needed stage for our spreadsheet. I discovered in the lesson that I did not have that much needed to accomplish and I only needed to add a drop down menu in it which was relatively straightforward. After I did this I asked the teacher what I should do and he said to add a link of my sheets to my post. He also said that he had explained this in a previous lesson. The lesson I learnt from this was that you should listen to what the teacher says at all times even if you don't need it then because it may be important for the future.
