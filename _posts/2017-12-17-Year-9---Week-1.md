The start of IT to this year was mediocre. Once again you will find me repeating the same targets. Firstly my concentration needs to improve. This is mainly because during the lesson I was distracted with my own thoughts. This hinders my learning as it makes me slower and reduces the rate of my learning. Furthermore I had to ask help as a result of this which prevented self-learning. For next lesson my main target is to concentrate as I learnt that if you don't listen the first time many problems will occur. To become more concentrated I will use methods such as not doing any fast paced activities before and drink some water to keep hydrated.
