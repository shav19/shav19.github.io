This week we started our new topic of It which is python turtle. I generally found it easy because our practise of the computing language last year. However at the start what we went through was GCSE Computer Science. Personally I don't think it is for me as I do not possess that type of mindset. The qualities I lack are extreme perseverance and a lot of logic and quick-thinking. But in the learning part of the lesson I managed to cope very well due to the work set being very easy.
